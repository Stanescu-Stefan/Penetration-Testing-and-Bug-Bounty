Bug bounty hunting is an exciting yet challenging field that requires the mastery of numerous tools and techniques. While graphical interfaces can simplify tasks, the real power often lies in command-line interfaces (CLI). For bug bounty hunters, knowing the right CLI commands and flags can make the difference between success and failure.

This guide explores 100 essential CLI flags and tricks across popular tools for reconnaissance, scanning, exploitation, and post-exploitation. Whether you're just starting out or refining your skills, these commands will boost your efficiency and effectiveness.

wfuzz -w wordlist.txt -u http://target/FUZZ – Fuzzing tool.
wfuzz -z range,1-100 – Use numeric range for fuzzing.
rescope -r scope.txt – Restrict scanning to in-scope domains.
Post-Exploitation Tools
After gaining access, these tools help you analyze and maintain your foothold:

john --wordlist=passwords.txt hash.txt – Crack hashes with wordlists.
hashcat -m 0 hash.txt passwords.txt – Use GPU for cracking hashes.
hashcat --show -m 0 hash.txt – Display cracked passwords.
sshuttle -r user@host 0/0 – Create a quick VPN-like tunnel.
proxychains tool – Route tools through a proxy.
socat -d -d TCP-LISTEN:4444 STDOUT – Create reverse shells.
